### Fallacy (谬误) 

A fallacy is a kind of error in reasoning. 
谬误是一种推理论证中产生的错误。

The vast majority of the commonly identified fallacies involve arguments, although some involve explanations, or definitions, or other products of reasoning. Sometimes the term "fallacy" is used even more broadly to indicate any false belief or cause of a false belief. 
大部分常见的谬误都是发生在"论据/观点"这个概念上的，也有的谬误发生在"解释"，"定义"等其他的"推理论证产物"上。有的时候"谬误"也被用来表示那些"错误的意见"或者"造成错误意见产生的原因"。

Strong arguments are void of logical fallacies, whilst arguments that are weak tend to use logical fallacies to appear stronger than they are. Fallacies should not be persuasive, but they often are. Fallacies may be created unintentionally, or they may be created intentionally in order to deceive other people. They're like tricks or illusions of thought, and they're often very sneakily used by politicians, the media, and others to fool people.
有力的论据是不存在逻辑谬误的，而无力的论据则倾向于利用逻辑谬误来显得比原来更有力。谬误本不应该具备说服力，但是它们却往往具备这样一种能力。谬误可能是无意之中产生的，也可能是人们为了误导他人而有意创造出来的。它们就像思维把戏，思维假象，经常被政客，媒体和其他居心叵测之人拿来愚弄群众。


### Formal Fallacy (形式谬误)

A formal fallacy is fallacious only because of its logical form. 
形式谬误是指: 只有逻辑形式错误的谬误

### Informal Fallacy (非形式谬误)

An informal fallacy is fallacious because of both its form and its content. 
非形式谬误是指: 不论是形式还是内容都是错误的谬误。

## Further

The discussion that precedes the long alphabetical list of fallacies begins with an account of the ways in which the term "fallacy" is vague. Attention then turns to the number of competing and overlapping ways to classify fallacies of argumentation. 
在深入了解后续的诸多谬误前，要知道人们对于"谬误"展开了许多讨论，在这些讨论中，"谬误"的定义仍是模糊的。人们把讨论的焦点聚集到了对论据里各种谬误进行分类的方法上，出现了许多交叉，竞争的分类方法。

For pedagogical purposes, researchers in the field of fallacies disagree about the following topics: which name of a fallacy is more helpful to students' understanding; whether some fallacies should be de-emphasized in favor of others; and which is the best taxonomy of the fallacies. 
为了教学规范的目的，在该领域内的学者们不认同以下的观点: 一个谬误用哪一个名字才最有利于学生理解？考虑到对一部分谬误的影响，是否应该弱化另一部分谬误？哪一个才是对谬误最好的的分类方法？

Researchers in the field are also deeply divided about how to define the term "fallacy" itself, how to define certain fallacies, and whether any theory of fallacies at all should be pursued if that theory's goal is to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing between fallacious and non-fallacious reasoning generally. 
在对如何定义"谬误"本身，如何定义特定谬误，以及是否应该追寻某个普适的，能为辨别谬误提供充分必要条件的理论这些问题上，学者们也都持有着不同的观点。

Analogously, there is doubt in the field of ethics regarding whether researchers should pursue the goal of providing necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing moral actions from immoral ones.
类似的，在道德领域里，是否应该追寻某个能为辨别道德与否提供充分必要条件的理论，也是学者们的疑虑所在。

## Ad Hominem (人身攻击)

> __Ad Hominem__ (_to the person/directed at the person_)

### Definition

Your reasoning contains this fallacy if you make an irrelevant attack on the arguer and suggest that this attack undermines the argument itself. 
当你对辩方作出和主题不相关的攻击并认为这可以削弱对方的观点时，你的推理就包含了这种谬误。

The major difficulty with labeling a piece of reasoning an Ad Hominem Fallacy is deciding whether the personal attack is relevant or irrelevant. For example, attacks on a person for their immoral sexual conduct are irrelevant to the quality of their mathematical reasoning, but they are relevant to arguments promoting the person for a leadership position in a church or mosque.
判定某段推理是否属于人身攻击谬误的最大的困难就是判定推理中包含着的人生攻击是否和论述的主题相关。比如，攻击某人有过不道德的性行为和他们进行的数学推理之间就没有关系，但是对于提拔某人作为教堂或者是清真寺领导者的观点而言，就有关系了。

### Example

What she says about Johannes Kepler's astronomy of the 1600s must be just so much garbage. Do you realize she's only fifteen years old? (This attack may undermine the young woman's credibility as a scientific authority, but it does not undermine her reasoning itself because her age is irrelevant to quality of her reasoning. That reasoning should stand or fall on the scientific evidence, not on the arguer's age or anything else about her personally.)
她谈论的关于17世纪，Johannes Kepler的天文学的内容肯定没什么价值。你有意识到她才只有15岁吗？(这种攻击可以削弱小女孩作为科学权威上的可信度，但是这并不能削弱她的推理本身，因为她的年龄和她推理的质量并没有关系。上述推理是基于科学依据的，而不是基于辩论者的年龄或者其他和她自身相关的信息。)

After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable
taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything
from a woman who isn't married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird.
当Sally极具说服力的展示了一个使用更加合理的税制的情况后，Sam就问听众，我们是否应该相信一个没有结过婚，曾经被捕过，而且笑的还很奇怪的女性说出来的话。

<a id="appeal_to_emotion"></a>

## Appeal to Emotion (诉诸感情)

### Definition

The fallacy of Appeal to Emotion is happened when someone hope you to accept their claim merely because the appeal arouses your feelings without a valid or compelling argument. The feelings contain anger, fear, grief, envy, hatred, love, outrage, pity, pride, sexuality, sympathy, guilt, relief, and so forth. 
诉诸情感的谬误发生在当一个人希望你接受他的观点仅仅是因为他唤起了你情感上的共鸣而不是提供一个有效的或者是无法驳倒的论据。这些情感包括了愤怒，恐惧，悲伤，嫉妒，憎恨，爱，愤慨，怜悯，骄傲，性冲动，同情，愧疚，宽慰等。

Though a valid, and reasoned argument may sometimes have an emotional aspect, one must be careful that emotion doesn't obscure or replace reason.
尽管一个有效且合理的论据可能有时也包含了情感的一面，但是一定要注意情感不能取代理性，或者是使理性的一面变的含混不清。

### Example

Luke didn't want to eat his sheep's brains with chopped liver and brussels
sprouts, but his father told him to think about the poor, starving children in a third world country who weren't fortunate enough to have any food at all.
Luke不愿吃他自己养的羊的脑袋配剁碎的肝和球芽甘蓝，但是他的爸爸告诉他，那些穷困饥饿的第三世界国家的小孩他们都没有足够的运气能吃上食物。

I met a little boy with cancer who lived just 20 miles from a power line who looked into my eyes and said, in his weak voice, “Please do whatever you can so that other kids won’t have to go through what I am going through.”  I urge you to vote for this bill to tear down all power lines and replace them with monkeys on treadmills.
我遇到一个得了癌症的小男孩他就住在一个离高压线塔20英里的地方，他看着我的眼睛，用他虚弱的声音说，"请尽你一切的可能让其他的孩子不要经历我经历的这些苦难"。我希望你们能够投票支持这个草案，拆除所有的高压电塔，并用猴子和跑步机进行发电。

<a id="appeal_to_ignorance"></a>

## Appeal to Ignorance (诉诸无知)

> __Argument from Ignorance__
> __Personal Incredulity__

### Definition

The Fallacy of Appeal to Ignorance comes in two forms: (1) Not knowing that a certain statement is true is taken to be a proof that it is false. (2) Not knowing that a statement is false is taken to be a proof that it is true. The fallacy occurs in cases where absence of evidence is not good enough evidence of absence. The fallacy uses an unjustified attempt to shift the burden of proof. 
诉诸无知的谬误有如下两种形式: (1) 把"不知道某种说法是正确的"作为这个说法错误的证据。 (2) 把"不知道某种说法是错误的"作为这个说法正确的证据。这种谬误发生在"'没有证据'不是一个好的'不在场证据'"的情况下。该谬误用一种不正当的方式尝试去转移证明的义务。

Saying that because one finds something difficult to understand, it's therefore not true. Subjects such as biological evolution via the process of natural selection require a good amount of understanding before one is able to properly grasp them; this fallacy is usually used in place of that understanding.
有人因为某件事情难以理解，就认为这不是真的。对于像"通过物竞天择实现生物学上的进化"这样的话题，人们需要有大量的知识储备，然后才能很好的理解它们。诉诸无知的谬误就经常被用在需要理解的地方。

### Example

Nobody has ever proved to me there's a God, so I know there is no God. (This kind of reasoning is generally fallacious. It would be proper reasoning only if the proof attempts were quite thorough, and it were the case that, if the being or object were to exist, then there would be a discoverable proof of this. Another common example of the fallacy involves ignorance of a future event: You people have been complaining about the danger of Xs ever since they were invented, but there's never been any big problem with Xs, so there's nothing to worry about.)
没人可以向我证明上帝的存在，所以上帝一定不存在。(这种推理方式通常都是谬误的。而且这种推理只有在尝试过非常彻底的证明，而且是去证明某个人或物是真实存在的情况下才是恰当的。另一个常见的谬误的例子是涉及了对未来事件的无知上: 自从X被发明出来以后，人们就经常抱怨X的危险性，但是X从来就没有发生过什么大问题，所以并不需要去担心。)

## Common Cause Fallacy (共因谬误)

> __Third Cause Fallacy__

### Definition

It is a kind of __[False Cause Fallacy](#false_cause_fallacy)__.
这是__[归因缪误](#false_cause_fallacy)__的一种。

This fallacy occurs during causal reasoning when a causal connection between two kinds of events is claimed when evidence is available indicating that both are the effect of a common cause.
该谬误是发生在有足够的证据显示一个因果关系中的两个事件都是一个共同原因的结果。

### Example

Noting that the auto accident rate rises and falls with the rate of use of windshield wipers, one concludes that the use of wipers is somehow causing auto accidents. (However, it's the rain that's the common cause of both.)
注意到车祸发生的机率随着使用雨刮的机率共同增减，所以有一种结论是，雨刮通过某种方式导致车祸的发生。(但是，是下雨才是两件事情的共同原因)

It seems that every time empty beer cans are piled up in a car, an accident occurs. It seems that the excess weight and shape of the cans must cause other cars to want to crash into the victim's car. But the possible cause of both phenomena is drunk driving.
好像每次车里放里空啤酒罐，就会有车祸发生。好像车里放着过量的啤酒罐就一定会导致其他车想要撞进这部车里。但是醉驾才是两件事情发生的原因。

<a id="cum_hoc_fallacy"></a>

## Cum Hoc Fallacy (随此归因谬误) 

> __Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc__ (_with this, therefore because of this_)

### Definition

It is a kind of __[False Cause Fallacy](#false_cause_fallacy)__.
这是__[归因缪误](#false_cause_fallacy)__的一种。

Event A and Event B both happened at the same time. Therefore, Event A caused Event B. 
事件A和事件B同时发生。因此，事件A导致事件B的发生。

This fallacy doesn't depend on time order (as does the __[Post Hoc Fallacy](#post_hoc_fallacy)__)
该谬误不依赖于时间顺序(如 __[后此归因缪误](#post_hoc_fallacy)__)

### Example

Gypsies live near our low-yield cornfields. So, gypsies must be causing the low yield.
吉普赛人住在低产玉米地附近，所以是吉普赛人导致玉米地的低产。

## Fallacy Fallacy (谬误谬误)

> __Argument from Fallacy__

### Definition

Presuming a claim to be necessarily wrong because a fallacy has been committed. It is entirely possible to make a claim that is false yet argue with logical coherency for that claim, just as it is possible to make a claim that is true and justify it with various fallacies and poor arguments. 
因为一个观点里存在着谬误，就认定这个观点一定是错的。完全有可能存在将一个错误的观点论证的合乎逻辑的情况，也可能存在用许多谬误和无力的论据去论证一个正确的观点的情况。

### Example

Recognising that Amanda had committed a fallacy in arguing that we should eat healthy food because a nutritionist said it was popular, Alyse said we should therefore eat bacon double cheeseburgers every day.
在确认了Amanda承认她在论证"因为营养学家说吃健康食物很热门，所以我们应该吃健康食品"这个观点上存在着谬误后，Alyse就认为我们应该每天吃双份的培根芝士汉堡。

Ivan: 你不能借我的车因为它在午夜会变成南瓜。

## False Cause Fallacy (归因缪误)

> __Non Causa Pro Causa__ (_Non-cause for cause_) 

### Definition

Improperly concluding that one thing is a cause of another. 
错误的把一件事归因于另一件事。

Many people confuse ___correlation___ (things happening together or in sequence) for ___causation___ (that one thing actually causes the other to happen). But sometimes correlation is coincidental ([Post Hoc Fallacy](#post_hoc_fallacy)，[Cum Hoc Fallacy](#cum_hoc_fallacy)，[Regression Fallacy](#regression_fallacy)), or it may be attributable to a common cause ([Common Cause Fallacy](#common_cause_fallacy)).
许多人把 ___相关性___ (事情同时发生或相继发生)和 ___因果性___ (一件事确实导致另一件事的发生)弄混了。但是，事件之间的相关性可能只是偶然存在的([后此归因谬误](#post_hoc_fallacy)，[随此归因谬误](#cum_hoc_fallacy)，[回归谬误](#regression_fallacy))，或者此类事件的发生可能归因于一个共同事件([共因谬误](#common_cause_fallacy))。

### Example

My psychic adviser says to expect bad things when Mars is aligned with Jupiter. Tomorrow Mars will be aligned with Jupiter. So, if a dog were to bite me tomorrow, it would be because of the alignment of Mars with Jupiter.
我的灵媒说，当火星和木星连成一条线的时候，就会有坏事发生。明天火星和木星会连成一条线，所以如果我明天被狗咬了，那么一定是火星和木星连线造成的结果。

Pointing to a fancy chart, Roger shows how temperatures have been rising over the past few centuries, whilst at the same time the numbers of pirates have been decreasing; thus pirates cool the world and global warming is a hoax.
Roger指出，根据图表显示，在过去几个世纪里，全球温度在不断升高，同事全球海盗数量也在逐渐减少，因此可以得出结论，是海盗可以降低全球气温。

## Genetic Fallacy (根源谬论)

### Definition

It is a kind of __[Ad Hominem](#ad_hominem)__.
这是__[人身攻击](#ad_hominem)__的一种。

A critic uses the Genetic Fallacy if the critic attempts to discredit or support a claim or an argument because of its origin (genesis) when such an appeal to origins is irrelevant.
如果一个评论员企图因为某个声明/观点的根源，而去削弱或者支持该声明/观点，但诉诸的根源却是不相关的，那么他就利用了根源谬误。

### Example

"Whatever your reasons are for buying that gift, they've got to be ridiculous. You said that you got the idea for buying it from last night's fortune cookie. Cookies can't think!" (Fortune cookies are not reliable sources of information about what gift to buy, but the reasons the person is willing to give are likely to be quite relevant and should be listened to. The speaker is using the Genetic Fallacy by paying too much attention to the genesis of the idea rather than to the reasons offered for it.)
"不论你买那个礼物的理由是什么，它们都是荒谬的。你说你是从昨晚的幸运饼干里得到了买这个礼物的想法，但是饼干并不会思考！" (幸运饼干不是一个决定买哪个礼物的可靠信息源，但是这个人想要表达的理由却是相关的而且应该被倾听的。但是说话人利用根源谬误，把注意力集中到了产生想法的根源，而不是真正产生想法的理由上。)

## Guilt by Association (牵连犯罪)

> __Circumstantial Ad Hominem__

### Definition

It is a kind of __[Ad Hominem](#ad_hominem)__.
这是__[人身攻击](#ad_hominem)__的一种。

A person is said to be guilty of error because of the group he or she associates with. The fallacy occurs when we unfairly try to change the issue to be about the speaker's circumstances rather than about the speaker's actual argument. 
一个人因为其所在的群体而被认为有罪。这种谬误发生在我们企图不正当的把问题转向到说话人所处的境遇里，而不是他真正的观点中。

### Example

Secretary of State Dean Acheson is too soft on communism, as you can see by his inviting so many fuzzy-headed liberals to his White House cocktail parties. (Has any evidence been presented here that Acheson's actions are inappropriate in regards to communism? This sort of reasoning is an example of McCarthyism, the technique of smearing liberal Democrats that was so effectively used by the late Senator Joe McCarthy in the early 1950s. In fact, Acheson was strongly anti-communist and the architect of President Truman's firm policy of containing Soviet power.)
国务卿Dean Acheson对待共产主义太软弱了，正如你看到的，他总是邀请一些头脑不清楚的自由主义者去他的白宫鸡尾酒会上。(在上述观点里，有提到任何能说明艾奇逊在针对共产主义时存在不恰当行为的证据吗？这类推理就是一个典型的麦卡锡主义的例子，这种抹黑自由民主主义者的技巧，非常有效的在20世纪50年代被参议院麦卡锡所使用。事实上，艾奇逊是一个强硬的反共主义者，而且是总统杜鲁门提出的控制苏维埃力量的政策的缔造者。)

## Regression Fallacy (回归谬误)

> __Regressive Fallacy__

### Definition

It is a kind of __[False Cause Fallacy](#false_cause_fallacy)__.
这是__[归因缪误](#false_cause_fallacy)__的一种。

This fallacy occurs when regression to the mean is mistaken for a sign of a causal connection. 
该谬误发生在错误的把回归现象(一般指回归到平均值的现象)当成是某种因果关系的表现形式。

### Example

When his pain got worse, he went to a doctor, after which the pain subsided a little. Therefore, he benefited from the doctor's treatment. (The pain subsiding a little after it has gotten worse is more easily explained by regression towards the mean. Assuming the pain relief was caused by the doctor is fallacious.)
当伤痛变的严重时，他去看了医生，看完以后，他的伤痛得到了一些缓解。因此，他通过医生的治疗使伤痛得到缓解。(但是，伤痛在加剧以后能够得到缓解，更好的解释应该是回归作用的影响，疼痛会回归到平均水平上。所以认为是医生缓解了疼痛的观点是存在谬误的。)

The student did exceptionally poorly last semester, so I punished him. He did much better this semester. Clearly, punishment is effective in improving students' grades. (Often exceptional performances are followed by more normal performances, so the change in performance might better be explained by regression towards the mean. Incidentally, some experiments have shown that people may develop a systematic error for punishment and against reward because of reasoning analogous to this example of the regression fallacy.)
这个学生在上个学期意外的表现的很差，所以我惩罚了他。这个学期，他表现的就好的多。很显然，惩罚对于提高学生的成绩很有效。(通常一个例外的表现后面往往跟随的都是更加正常的表现，所以这样的在表现上的变化更好的解释应该是回归作用，表现回归到平均水准上。顺带一提，一些实验显示出人们在面对惩罚和奖励时，他们的表现可能会存在着系统性偏差，即有的表现更好，有的表现更差，但都在平均水平上下浮动，这和上述回归谬误的例子存在着逻辑相似性，即都是因为回归作用的影响。)

Some authors use __the Sports Illustrated cover jinx__(The Sports Illustrated cover jinx is an urban legend which states that individuals or teams who appear on the cover of the Sports Illustrated magazine will subsequently be jinxed) as an example of a regression effect: extremely good performances are likely to be followed by less extreme ones, and athletes are chosen to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated only after extreme performances. Attributing this to a "jinx" rather than regression, as some athletes reportedly believe, is an example of committing the regression fallacy.
许多作家选择 __体育画报封面之厄运__ (体育画报封面之厄运是一个都市传奇，当运动员或运动团体出现在体育画报杂志的封面上后，厄运就会随之而来)作为回归作用的例子: 非常出色的表现之后通常跟上的都是相对没那么出色的表现，而运动员们会被选中作为体育画报的封面，只会发生在他们发挥出自己的最高水准之后。有些运动员们据报道相信这是因为厄运而不是回归的作用，这就是一个典型的回归谬误的例子

Drawing an improper conclusion about causation due to a causal assumption that reverses cause and effect. (The cause is said to be the effect and vice versa.)

(The false assumption here is that having a big boat helps cause you to be an officer in MEP, whereas the reverse is true. Being an officer causes you to have the high income that enables you to purchase a big boat.)
所有迈阿密电子电力公司的职员都有一艘大船。如果你准备成为公司的一员，那么你最好也去买一艘大船。(错误的假设是拥有了一艘大船可以帮助你成为公司的一员，但是反过来才是正确的因果关系，成为公司的一员能够让你有足够的收入去买一艘大船。)

## Slippery Slope (滑坡谬误)

> __Domino Fallacy__

### Definition

Suppose someone claims that a first step (in a chain of causes and effects, or a chain of reasoning) will probably lead to a second step that in turn will probably lead to another step and so on until a final step ends in trouble. If the likelihood of the trouble occurring is exaggerated, the Slippery Slope Fallacy is present.
假设某人强调在某个因果关系链/逻辑关系链中，第一个事件很有可能会导致第二个事件的发生，相应的会导致后续一系列事件的发生，直至最后一个事件的发生伴随着糟糕的结局。如果问题发生的几率被夸大了，那么就出现了滑坡谬误。

The form of a Slippery Slope Fallacy looks like this:
> A often leads to B.
> B often leads to C.
> C often leads to D.
> ...
> Z will leads to HELL.
> 
> We don't want to go to HELL.
> So don't take the first step A.

滑坡谬误的表现形式如下所示:
> 事件A 往往会导致 事件B 的发生
> 事件B 往往会导致 事件C 的发生
> 事件C 往往会导致 事件D 的发生
> ...
> 事件Z 会带来 灾难
> 
> 既然我们不希望受到灾难
> 那么我们就不要进行第一步，也即事件A

The problem with this reasoning is that it avoids engaging with the issue at hand, and instead shifts attention to baseless extreme hypotheticals. The merits of the original argument are then tainted by unsubstantiated conjecture.
这个谬误的问题在于，他回避了当下应当考虑的问题，而把注意力转移到离谱的极端假设上。导致原观点中那些值得肯定的地方因为这些未经证实的揣测而变质。

The key claim in the fallacy is that taking the first step will lead to the final, unacceptable step. Arguments of this form may or may not be fallacious depending on the probabilities involved in each step. 
谬误的关键在于其认为第一步会导致无法接受的最后一步。但是这种形式的观点是否可能是谬误取决于每一步发生的可能性。

### Example

Colin Closet asserts that if we allow same-sex couples to marry, then the next thing we know we'll be allowing people to marry their parents, their cars and even monkeys.
Colin Closet断言如果我们允许同性伴侣结婚，那么接下来我们就会允许人们和他们的父母，车子，甚至猴子结婚。

Mom: Those look like bags under your eyes. Are you getting enough sleep?
Jeff: I had a test and stayed up late studying.
Mom: You didn't take any drugs, did you?
Jeff: Just caffeine in my coffee, like I always do.
Mom: Jeff! You know what happens when people take drugs! Pretty soon the caffeine won't be strong enough. Then you will take something stronger, maybe someone's diet pill. Then, something even stronger. Eventually, you will be doing cocaine. Then you will be a crack addict! So, don't drink that coffee.
妈妈: 你的眼袋就像两个包。你睡够了吗？
Jeff: 我昨天有一场考试，所以我熬夜学习了。
妈妈: 你没有嗑药吧？
Jeff: 像往常一样，就是我咖啡里的咖啡因而已。
妈妈: Jeff！你知道人们嗑药后都发生什么了吗！很快那些咖啡因就没有那么有效了。接下来你就会用一些更猛的药，可能是某些人的减肥药丸。再然后，就是一些更猛的药。最后，你就会吸食可卡因，然后变成一个瘾君子！所以别再喝咖啡了！

<a id="special_pleading"></a>

## Special Pleading (诡辩术)

### Definition

Special pleading is a form of inconsistency in which the reasoner doesn't apply his or her principles consistently. It is the fallacy of applying a general principle to various situations but not applying it to a special situation that interests the arguer even though the general principle properly applies to that special situation, too.

Example:

Everyone has a duty to help the police do their job, no matter who the suspect is. That is why we must support investigations into corruption in the police department. No person is above the law. Of course, if the police come knocking on my door to ask about my neighbors and the robberies in our building, I know nothing. I'm not about to rat on anybody.

In our example, the principle of helping the police is applied to investigations of police officers but not to one's neighbors.





Moving the goalposts or making up exceptions when a
claim is shown to be false.
Humans are funny creatures and have a foolish aversion to being wrong.
Rather than appreciate the benefits of being able to change one's mind
through better understanding, many will invent ways to cling to old beliefs.
Edward Johns claimed to be psychic, but when his 'abilities' were tested under
proper scientific conditions, they magically disappeared. Edward explained this
saying that one had to have faith in his abilities for them to work.
当你的观点被证明是错误的时候，你用特例来给自己开脱。

人类都不喜欢被证明是错的，所以当他们被证明是错的时候总会想办法给自己开脱。人总是觉得自己以前觉得正确的东西必须是正确的吗，所以总能找到理由让自己阿Q一下。只有诚实和勇敢的人才能面对自己的错误，并且承认自己犯错了。

例子: 小红说自己有特异功能，能用塔罗牌算出未出生小孩的性别，但是孩子生下来后发现猜错了，于是她就说是算命的人缺乏信仰。小红犯了片面谬误。

<a id="straw_man"></a>

## Straw Man (稻草人) 

### Definition

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e. "stand up a straw man") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument ("knock down a straw man") instead of the opponent's proposition.
一个典型的稻草人观点就是通过隐蔽方式，将一个不同的观点替换了对手实际的观点，创造出一个能彻底的驳斥或者是击败对手假象。接下来的驳斥过程就是针对虚构的观点，而不是对手真实的观点。

By exaggerating, misrepresenting, or just completely fabricating someone's argument, the argument is much easier to be attacked and then you can present your own position as being reasonable, but this kind of dishonesty will undermine the debate's rationality.
通过夸大、歪曲，甚至凭空捏造他人的观点，可以让他人的观点更容易被攻击，接着你在表达自己立场时就会显得更加合理。但是这种不诚实的行为削弱了讨论的合理性。

This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery "battle" and the defeat of an "enemy" may be more valued than critical thinking or understanding both sides of the issue.
这个技巧在争议性辩论的历史中不断的使用。特别是在观点充斥着情感问题的情况下，那么进行一场激烈的"战斗"，并把"敌人"击溃与批判性的去思考和理解这个问题的方方面面相比，人们更重视前者。

### Example

After Will said that we should put more money into health and education, Warren responded by saying that he was surprised that Will hates our country so much that he wants to leave it defenceless by cutting military spending.
Will说我们应该投入更多的经费到医疗和教育上，Warren说他非常震惊，Will居然厌恶自己的国家到了想要通过削减国防预算使国家变的不堪一击的地步。

A: Because of the killing and suffering of Indians that followed Columbus's discovery of America, the City of Berkeley should declare that Columbus Day will no longer be observed in our city.
B: This is ridiculous. It's not true that everybody who ever came to America from another country somehow oppressed the Indians. I say we should continue to observe Columbus Day, and vote down this resolution that will make the City of Berkeley the laughing stock of the nation.
(B has twisted what his opponent, A said; the opponent never said, nor even indirectly suggested, that everybody who ever came to America from another country somehow oppressed the Indians.)
A: 因为随着哥伦布发现美洲大陆，印第安人遭到杀戮和迫害，所以伯克利应该声明不再设立哥伦布日。
B: 这太荒谬了，并不是每个人一到美洲就通过某种方式去对印第安人施压。我觉得我们应该继续设立哥伦布日，并投票否决这项会让伯克利称为国家笑柄的决议。
(B扭曲了他对手A的观点，A并没有说过，甚至都没有间接的暗示过所有去美洲的人都会迫害印第安人这个观点。)

## Tu Quoque (你也一样) 

> __Tu Quoque__ (_you also_)

### Definition

It is a kind of __[Ad Hominem](#ad_hominem)__.
这是__[人身攻击](#ad_hominem)__的一种。

The fallacy of Tu Quoque occurs in our reasoning if we conclude that someone's argument not to perform some act must be faulty because the arguer himself or herself has performed it. Similarly, when we point out that the arguer doesn't practice what he or she preaches, and then suppose that there must be an error in the preaching for only this reason, then we are reasoning fallaciously and creating a Tu Quoque.
你也一样的谬误发生在当我们因为辩论者自身存在某些行为，就得出他/她说某些行为不可为的观点是错误的结论。类似的，当我们指出辩论者并没有做到他/她所说教的那些内容，并且仅凭此认为说教的内容必定存在错误，那么我们就的推理就存在你也一样的谬误。



Avoiding having to engage with criticism by turning it back on the accuser and answering criticism with criticism.Literally translating as 'you too' this fallacy is commonly employed as an effective red herring because it takes the heat off the accused having to defend themselves and shifts the focus back onto the accuser themselves
通过将矛头调转，指向批评自己的人，把批评别人作为被别人批评时，自己的回复，避免正面回应别人的批评。确实，这种'你也一样'的谬误非常常见的被用于进行有效的注意力转移(red herring)上，因为这让被告不用再为自己辩护，而是把注意力转移回原告的身上。

### Example

"Look who's talking. You say I shouldn't become an alcoholic because it will hurt me and my family, yet you yourself are an alcoholic, so your argument can't be worth listening to." (Discovering that a speaker is a hypocrite is a reason to be suspicious of the speaker's reasoning, but it is not a sufficient reason to discount it.)
"瞧瞧谁正在说话呢，你说我不能变成一个酒鬼因为这会毁了我和我的家庭，但是你自己却是一个酒鬼，所以你的观点并不值得听。" (发现说话者是个伪君子可以作为质疑其观点的理由，但是却不是一个能够不相信该观点的充分理由。)

## Two Wrongs Make a Right (负负得正) 

### Definition

It is a kind of __[Ad Hominem](#ad_hominem)__.
这是__[人身攻击](#ad_hominem)__的一种。

When you defend your wrong action as being right because someone previously has acted wrongly, you are using the fallacy called "Two Wrongs Make a Right". 
当你用别人曾经犯过的错误来为自己的错误行为进行辩护时，你就犯了负负得正的谬误。

### Example

"Oops, no paper this morning. Somebody in our apartment building probably stole my newspaper. So, that makes it OK for me to steal one from my neighbor's doormat while nobody else is out here in the hallway."
"哎呀，今天早上没有报纸。一定是我们公寓某个人偷了我的报纸。既然这样，那么我趁楼道里没人的时候，把邻居的门垫偷走也没问题吧。"

## loaded question         (诱导性问题)

Asking a question that has an assumption built into it so
that it can't be answered without appearing guilty.
Loaded question fallacies are particularly e_ective at derailing rational debates
because of their inflammatory nature - recipients of a loaded question are
compelled to defend themselves and may appear flustered or on the back foot.
Grace and Helen were both romantically interested in Brad. One day, with
Brad sitting within earshot, Grace asked in an inquisitive tone whether Helen
was having any problems with a fungal infection.
你在提出问题的时候加入了诱导的成分，使得对方只能按着你的意思来回答。

你试图用诱导性的问题来逼对方回答你提出的低级问题，从而破坏理性的讨论。

例子: 小红怀疑自己的丈夫孙越搞外遇，为了一探究竟，于是就问他: "陈轩的屁股上是不是有个胎记？"小红使用的就是诱导性问题。

---


## burden of proof         (举证责任)

Saying that the burden of proof lies not with the person
making the claim, but with someone else to disprove.
The burden of proof lies with someone who is making a claim, and is not upon
anyone else to disprove. The inability, or disinclination, to disprove a claim does
not make it valid (however we must always go by the best available evidence).
Bertrand declares that a teapot is, at this very moment, in orbit around the
Sun between the Earth and Mars, and that because no one can prove him
wrong his claim is therefore a valid one.
你认为举证责任不在提出观点的人，而在于质疑观点的人。

当有人提出一个观点结果被人质疑后，你认为举证的责任不在提出观点的人，而在质疑者。不能证伪一个事物，或者举出反例，并不能证明这个事物的合理性。当然，如果只因为没有足够的证据说明一个事物是合理的并不能肯定的说明它是不合理的。

例子: 小红说他相信宇宙是一个叫KengDie的全知全能神创造的，因为没有人能证明KengDie不存在，所以KengDie是存在的。小红犯了举证责任的谬误。

---


## ambiguity               (语义模糊)

Using double meanings or ambiguities of language to
mislead or misrepresent the truth.
Politicians are often guilty of using ambiguity to mislead and will later point to
how they were technically not outright lying if they come under scrutiny.
It's a particularly tricky and premeditated fallacy to commit.
When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he
said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking
here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there.
你用双关语或者意思存有歧义的语言来歪曲事实。

你使用双关语或者意思存有歧义的语言，当你被别人批评的时候又利用这些有歧义的语言作为自己的挡箭牌。

例子: 地上一个猴，树上qi个猴，一共几个猴？

---


## the gambler's fallacy   (赌徒谬误)

Believing that 'runs' occur to statistically independent
phenomena such as roulette wheel spins.
This commonly believed fallacy can be said to have helped create a city in the
desert of Nevada USA. Though the overall odds of a 'big run' happening may be
low, each spin of the wheel is itself entirely independent from the last.
Red had come up six times in a row on the roulette wheel, so Greg knew that
it was close to certain that black would be next up. Su_ering an economic
form of natural selection with this thinking, he soon lost all of his savings.
你认为随机事物的发生和之前发生的事情是有相关性的。

有人在看到独立的随机事件(比如抛硬币)时，总觉得会和前面的事情有相关性(前面连着五个正面，下一个肯定要是反面了。)

---

## bandwagon               (乐队花车)

Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do
something as an attempted form of validation.
The flaw in this argument is that the popularity of an idea has absolutely no
bearing on its validity. If it did, then the Earth would have made itself flat for
most of history to accommodate this popular belief.
Shamus pointed a drunken finger at Sean and asked him to explain how so
many people could believe in leprechauns if they're only a silly old superstition.
Sean, however, had had a few too many Guinness himself and fell o_ his chair.
你试图说明因为很多人都在做同一件事情/相信同一件事物，这件事情就是对的。

一个事物/观点的流行程度和它本身是否合理没有关系。地球是球形的，在人们相信地球是平的时代地球也是球形的，地球才不管你信不信它呢。

例子: 看到《货币战争》那么畅销，小红相信一定是罗斯柴尔德和共济会在背后操纵着整个世界。小红犯了乐队花车谬误。

---


## appeal to authority     (诉诸权威)

Saying that because an authority thinks something,
it must therefore be true.
It's important to note that this fallacy should not be used to dismiss the claims of
experts, or scientific consensus. Appeals to authority are not valid arguments, but
nor is it reasonable to disregard the claims of experts who have a demonstrated
depth of knowledge unless one has a similar level of understanding.
Not able to defend his position that evolution 'isn't true' Bob says that he knows a
scientist who also questions evolution (and presumably isn't herself a primate).
你利用一个权威人物/机构的观点来取代一个有力的论述。

要证明一个观点，只是摘录别人的观点是不够的， 至少要知道所提到的权威为什么有那样的观点。因为权威人物/机构也是会犯错误的，所以不能无条件的假设合理性。当然，权威人物/机构的观点有可能是对的，所以不能只因为对方使用了诉诸权威的谬误就认定这个观点肯定是错的。

例子: 小红不知道怎么反驳进化论，于是就说: "我老公孙越是大科学家，他觉得进化论是错的。"小红犯了诉诸权威的额谬误。

---

## composition/division    (合成谬误)

Assuming that what's true about one part of something
has to be applied to all, or other, parts of it.
Often when something is true for the part it does also apply to the whole, but
because this isn't always the case it can't be presumed to be true. We must
show evidence for why a consistency will exist.
Daniel was a precocious child and had a liking for logic. He reasoned that
atoms are invisible, and that he was made of atoms and therefore invisible too.
Unfortunately, despite his thinky skills, he lost the game of hide and go seek.
你认为一个总体的组成部分所具有的特性，对于这个总体的其它部分也是普适的。

很多时候，对于一个组成部分存在合理性的事物，对于其它组成部分并不具有合理性。我们常能观察到事物之间的一致性，所以当一致性不存在的时候也会偏见的认为有一致性。

例子: 小红买了辆自行车，当她看到自行车的车座是人造革的时候，她就觉得自行车的其它部位也是人造革的。

---


## no true scotsman        (没有真正的苏格兰人)

Making what could be called an appeal to purity as a way
to dismiss relevant criticisms or flaws of an argument.
This fallacy is often employed as a measure of last resort when a point has been
lost. Seeing that a criticism is valid, yet not wanting to admit it, new criteria are
invoked to dissociate oneself or one's argument.
Angus declares that Scotsmen do not put sugar on their porridge, to which
Lachlan points out that he is a Scotsman and puts sugar on his porridge.
Furious, like a true Scot, Angus yells that no true Scotsman sugars his porridge.
你提出了一个观点，并收到了别人的批评，你试图用"诉诸纯洁"的方式来捍卫自己的观点。

你试图通过马后炮和修改标准的方式来维护自己那有缺陷的观点。

例子: 
小红: "所有荷兰人都喜欢喝胡辣汤"。
小明: "孙越就是荷兰人，他就不喜欢喝胡辣汤。"
小红: "好吧，所有【真正的】荷兰人都喜欢喝胡辣汤。"<——小红这里就犯了"没有真正的苏格兰人"的谬误

---

## genetic                 (基因谬误)

Judging something good or bad on the basis of where it
comes from, or from whom it comes.
To appeal to prejudices surrounding something's origin is another red herring
fallacy. This fallacy has the same function as an ad hominem, but applies
instead to perceptions surrounding something's source or context.
Accused on the 6 o'clock news of corruption and taking bribes, the senator
said that we should all be very wary of the things we hear in the media,
because we all know how very unreliable the media can be.
你通过一个事物的出身来判断它的好坏。

你试图逃避正面的讨论，而转而讨论事物的出处。这种做法和本文第六条"人身攻击"类似，都是想试图通过已有的负面印象来从侧面攻击对方，却不能正面的回应对方的论述。

例子: 
小明: "孙越不喜欢喝胡辣汤。"
小红: "孙越是荷兰人，怎么会不喜欢喝胡辣汤？"<——小红这里就犯了基因谬误

---


## black or white          (非黑即白)

Where two alternative states are presented as the only
possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist.
Also known as the false dilemma, this insidious tactic has the appearance of
forming a logical argument, but under closer scrutiny it becomes evident that
there are more possibilities than the either/or choice that is presented.
Whilst rallying support for his plan to fundamentally undermine citizens'
rights, the Supreme Leader told the people they were either on his side, or on
the side of the enemy.
你把黑和白作为仅有的可能，却忽略了其它可能性的存在。

你使用了简单粗暴的假二分法，来掩盖其它可能性的存在。你想通过非黑即白的选择来误导讨论，破坏辩论的建设性。

例子: 在谈到反恐战争时，总统说如果你不支持反恐战争，你就是支持恐怖分子。总统这里犯了非黑即白的谬误。

---


## begging the question    (窃取论点)

A circular argument in which the conclusion is included
in the premise.
This logically incoherent argument often arises in situations where people
have an assumption that is very ingrained, and therefore taken in their minds
as a given. Circular reasoning is bad mostly because it's not very good.
The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect. We know this because it
says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo's Best and Most Truest
Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned.
你采用循环论证的方法来证明一个被包含在前提里面的观点。

这是一种逻辑智商破产的谬误，因为你把你的前提假设默认为真的，然后利用循环论证的方式来证明它。

例子: KengDie教的经文《KengDie Sutra》里面说的东西都是真理，因为在《KengDie Sutra》第一章第二段里面提到了"KengDie所述都是真理。"

---


## appeal to nature        (诉诸自然)

Making the argument that because something is 'natural'
it is therefore valid, justified, inevitable, good, or ideal.
Many 'natural' things are also considered 'good', and this can bias our thinking;
but naturalness itself doesn't make something good or bad. For instance
murder could be seen as very natural, but that doesn't mean it's justifiable.
The medicine man rolled into town on his bandwagon o_ering various
natural remedies, such as very special plain water. He said that it was only
natural that people should be wary of 'artificial' medicines like antibiotics.
你认为一个事物是"自然"的，所以它是合理、必然并且更好的。

一个事物是自然的并不一定代表它就更好。互相杀戮是大自然中普遍存在的现象，但是大多数人都认为我们不应该互相屠杀。

例子: 小红认为吃草药肯定比吃人工制造的药有效，因为草药更加"自然"。小红犯了诉诸自然的谬误

---


## anecdotal               (轶事证据)

Using personal experience or an isolated example instead
of a valid argument, especially to dismiss statistics.
It's often much easier for people to believe someone's testimony as opposed to
understanding variation across a continuum. Scientific and statistical measures
are almost always more accurate than individual perceptions and experiences.
Jason said that that was all cool and everything, but his grandfather smoked,
like, 30 cigarettes a day and lived until 97 - so don't believe everything you read
about meta analyses of sound studies showing proven causal relationships.
你试图用个人经验或者单独事例来取代逻辑论述或者有力的证据。

比起复杂而确凿的证据来说，轶事证据更容易获得，但是却要粗浅很多。在绝大多数情况下，量化衡量的科学数据/确凿证据比个人经验/轶事要更加可信。

例子: 小红爷爷是个30年的老烟枪，现在80多岁身体还很健康，小红依次得出吸烟对身体无害的结论。小红犯了轶事证据的谬误。

---


## the texas sharpshooter  (德克萨斯神枪手)
Cherry-picking data clusters to suit an argument, or
finding a pattern to fit a presumption.
This 'false cause' fallacy is coined after a marksman shooting at barns and then
painting a bullseye target around the spot where the most bullet holes appear.
Clusters naturally appear by chance, and don't necessarily indicate causation.
The makers of Sugarette Candy Drinks point to research showing that of the
five countries where Sugarette drinks sell the most units, three of them are in
the top ten healthiest countries on Earth, therefore Sugarette drinks are healthy.
你在大量的数据/证据中小心的挑选出对自己的观点有利的证据，而不使用那些对自己不利的数据/证据。

你先开了一枪，然后在子弹击中的地方画上靶心，搞得自己真是个神枪手一样。你先决定了自己的立场，然后才开始找证据，并且你只找对自己有利的，而对于那些对自己不利的就选择性忽略。

例子: 红X字会为了证明自己尽到了职责，到处宣传自己拨出了XXXX的善款，却只字不提自己公款消费的奢侈无度。红X字会犯了"德克萨斯神枪手"谬误

---


## mididle ground          (中间立场)

Saying that a compromise, or middle point, between two
extremes must be the truth.
Much of the time the truth does indeed lie between two extreme points, but
this can bias our thinking: sometimes a thing is simply untrue and a
compromise of it is also untrue. Half way between truth and a lie, is still a lie.
Holly said that vaccinations caused autism in children, but her scientifically
well-read friend Caleb said that this claim had been debunked and proven false.
Their friend Alice o_ered a compromise that vaccinations cause some autism.
你觉得两个极端观点的妥协，或者说中间立场，肯定是对的。

虽然大多数时候，真理确实存在于两种极端的中间地带，但是你不能轻易的认为只要是处于中间立场的观点就一定是正确的。谎言和实话的中间地带依然是谎言。

例子: 小红认为疫苗会造成儿童自闭症，孙越从科学研究的结论中得出结论认为疫苗不会造成儿童自闭症，小明认为两者观点的妥协——疫苗会造成儿童自闭症，但不是全部的儿童自闭症——才是正确的。小明犯了中间立场的谬误。
