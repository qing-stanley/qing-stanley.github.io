# FALLACY (逻辑谬误)

A fallacy is a kind of error in reasoning. 

Fallacies should not be persuasive, but they often are. Fallacies may be created unintentionally, or they may be created intentionally in order to deceive other people. The vast majority of the commonly identified fallacies involve arguments, although some involve explanations, or definitions, or other products of reasoning. Sometimes the term "fallacy" is used even more broadly to indicate any false belief or cause of a false belief. The list below includes some fallacies of these sorts, but most are fallacies that involve kinds of errors made while arguing informally in natural language.

An informal fallacy is fallacious because of both its form and its content. The formal fallacies are fallacious only because of their logical form. For example, the Slippery Slope Fallacy has this form: Step 1 often leads to step 2. Step 2 often leads to step 3. Step 3 often leads to ... until we reach an obviously unacceptable step, so step 1 is not acceptable. That form occurs in both good arguments and fallacious arguments. The quality of an argument of this form depends crucially on the probabilities that each step does lead to the next. Notice that the probabilities involve the argument's content, not merely its form.

The discussion that precedes the long alphabetical list of fallacies begins with an account of the ways in which the term "fallacy" is vague. Attention then turns to the number of competing and overlapping ways to classify fallacies of argumentation. For pedagogical purposes, researchers in the field of fallacies disagree about the following topics: which name of a fallacy is more helpful to students' understanding; whether some fallacies should be de-emphasized in favor of others; and which is the best taxonomy of the fallacies. Researchers in the field are also deeply divided about how to define the term "fallacy" itself, how to define certain fallacies, and whether any theory of fallacies at all should be pursued if that theory's goal is to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing between fallacious and non-fallacious reasoning generally. Analogously, there is doubt in the field of ethics regarding whether researchers should pursue the goal of providing necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing moral actions from immoral ones.


A logical fallacy is a flaw in reasoning.

Strong arguments are void of logical fallacies, whilst arguments that are weak tend to use logical fallacies to appear stronger than they are. They're like tricks or illusions of thought, and they're often very sneakily used by politicians, the media, and others to fool people.

<a id="cum_hoc"></a>
## Cum Hoc (随此归因谬误)
> __Cum Hoc Fallacy__ 
> __Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc__ (_with this, therefore because of this_)

### definition
It is a kind of __[False Cause](#false_cause)__.
这是归因缪误的一种。

Event A and Event B both happened at the same time. Therefore, Event A caused Event B. 
事件A和事件B同时发生。因此，事件A导致事件B的发生。

This fallacy doesn't depend on time order (as does the __[Post Hoc](#post_hoc)__)
该谬误不依赖于时间顺序(如 __后此归因缪误__)

### example
Gypsies live near our low-yield cornfields. So, gypsies must be causing the low yield.
吉普赛人住在低产玉米地附近，所以吉普赛人造成了玉米地地产。

<a id="false_cause"></a>
## False Cause (归因缪误)
> __False Cause Fallacy__ 
> __Non Causa Pro Causa__ (_Non-cause for cause_) 

### definition
Improperly concluding that one thing is a cause of another. 
错误的得出一件事归因于另一件事的结论。

Many people confuse ___correlation___ (things happening together or in sequence) for ___causation___ (that one thing actually causes the other to happen). But sometimes correlation is coincidental, or it may be attributable to a common cause.
许多人把 ___相关性___ (事情同时发生或相继发生)和 ___因果性___ (一件事确实导致另一件事的发生)弄混了。但是，事件之间的相关性可能只是偶然存在的，或者此类事件的发生可能归因于一个共同事件。

### example
My psychic adviser says to expect bad things when Mars is aligned with Jupiter. Tomorrow Mars will be aligned with Jupiter. So, if a dog were to bite me tomorrow, it would be because of the alignment of Mars with Jupiter.
我的灵媒说，当火星和木星连成一条线的时候，就会有坏事发生。明天火星和木星会连成一条线，所以如果我明天被狗咬了，那么一定是火星和木星连线造成的结果。

Pointing to a fancy chart, Roger shows how temperatures have been rising over the past few centuries, whilst at the same time the numbers of pirates have been decreasing; thus pirates cool the world and global warming is a hoax.
Roger指出，根据图表显示，在过去几个世纪里，全球温度在不断升高，同事全球海盗数量也在逐渐减少，因此可以得出结论，是海盗可以降低全球气温。

## Post Hoc (后此归因谬误)
> __Post Hoc Fallacy__
> __Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc__ (_after this, therefore because of this_)

### definition
It is a kind of __[False Cause](#false_cause)__.
这是归因缪误的一种。

Event A happened prior to Event B. Therefore, Event A caused Event B. 
事件A在事件B之前发生。因此，事件A导致事件B的发生。

### example
Roosters crow just before the sun rises. 
Therefore, roosters crowing cause the sun to rise.
公鸡在太阳升起前啼鸣，因此是公鸡啼鸣导致太阳升起。

I ate in that Ethiopian restaurant three days ago and now I've just gotten food poisoning. I've eaten in an Ethiopian restaurant before and I also got food poisoning a week later. So my eating in those kinds of restaurants is causing my food poisoning.
三天前我在一家埃塞俄比亚餐馆吃饭，现在我食物中毒了。此前我在另一家埃塞俄比亚餐馆吃饭，一周后我也食物中毒了。所以在这类餐馆吃饭会导致我食物中毒。

<a id="straw_man"></a>
## Straw Man (稻草人) 

Misrepresenting someone’s argument to make it easier to attack.

By exaggerating, misrepresenting, or just completely fabricating someone's argument, it's much easier to present your own position as being reasonable, but this kind of dishonesty serves to undermine rational debate.

After Will said that we should put more money into health and education, Warren responded by saying that he was surprised that Will hates our country so much that he wants to leave it defenceless by cutting military spending.

你歪曲了别人的观点，使你自己能够更加轻松的攻击别人。

你夸张、歪曲，甚至凭空创造了别人的观点，来让你本身的观点显得更加合理。这是一种极端不诚实的行为，这不但影响了理性的讨论，也影响了你自己观点的可信度。因为如果你可以负面的歪曲别人的观点，你就有可能从正面歪曲自己的观点。

例子：小明说国家应该投入更多的预算来发展教育行业，小红回复到：“想不到你这么不爱国，居然想减少国防开支，让外国列强有机可乘。” 小红就犯了稻草人谬误。

## appeal to emotion (诉诸感情)

Manipulating an emotional response in place of a valid
or compelling argument.
Appeals to emotion include appeals to fear, envy, hatred, pity, guilt, and more.
Though a valid, and reasoned, argument may sometimes have an emotional
aspect, one must be careful that emotion doesn’t obscure or replace reason.
Luke didn’t want to eat his sheep’s brains with chopped liver and brussels
sprouts, but his father told him to think about the poor, starving children in a
third world country who weren’t fortunate enough to have any food at all.
你试图通过操作别人的感情来取代一个有力的论述。

你操作的感情可能包括恐惧、嫉妒、怜悯、骄傲等等。一个逻辑严谨的论述可能激起别人的情感波动，但是如果只用感情操作而不用逻辑论述，那你就犯了诉诸感情的错误。每个心智健康的人都会受感情影响，所以这种谬误很有效，但这也是为什么这种谬误是低级和不诚实的手段。

例子：小红在饭店看到小明吃狗肉，于是上前训斥：“你怎么可以吃狗肉，小狗多么可爱，就像小朋友一样，你忍心伤害小朋友吗？” 小红犯了诉诸感情的谬误。

---


## the fallacy fallacy (谬误谬误)
Presuming a claim to be necessarily wrong because a
fallacy has been committed.
It is entirely possible to make a claim that is false yet argue with logical
coherency for that claim, just as it is possible to make a claim that is true and
justify it with various fallacies and poor arguments.
Recognising that Amanda had committed a fallacy in arguing that we should
eat healthy food because a nutritionist said it was popular, Alyse said we
should therefore eat bacon double cheeseburgers every day.
你看到别人的论述水平很低，或者别人的论述里面有谬误，就认为别人的观点一定是错误的。

很多时候，辩论的赢家获胜并不是因为观点正确，而是因为辩论技巧更好。作为一个理性的人，你不能因为别人的论述中存在谬误或者错误，就认为别人的观点一定是错误的。

例子：一个提倡健康饮食的人在电视上发表了很荒唐的饮食理论来推广健康饮食理念，小红看后觉得健康饮食就是骗人的，于是开始每天暴饮暴食。小红犯了谬误谬误。

---

## slippery slope (滑坡谬误)
Asserting that if we allow A to happen, then Z will
consequently happen too, therefore A should not happen.
The problem with this reasoning is that it avoids engaging with the issue at
hand, and instead shifts attention to baseless extreme hypotheticals. The merits
of the original argument are then tainted by unsubstantiated conjecture.
Colin Closet asserts that if we allow same-sex couples to marry, then the next
thing we know we’ll be allowing people to marry their parents, their cars and
even monkeys.
你搞得好像如果A发生了，那么Z也一定会发生会，以此来表示A不应该发生。

你不讨论现下的事物(A)，而是把讨论重心转移到了意淫出来的极端事物(Z)。因为你没能给出任何证据来证明A的发生一定会造成极端事物Z的发生，所以这是一种诉诸恐惧的谬误，也影响了人们讨论A时候的客观性。

例子：小红反对同性恋婚姻，因为她认为如果我们允许同性恋结婚，那么就会有人想要和桌子、椅子结婚。小红犯了滑坡谬论。

---

## ad hominem              (人身攻击)

Attacking your opponent’s character or personal traits in
an attempt to undermine their argument.
Ad hominem attacks can take the form of overtly attacking somebody, or casting
doubt on their character. The result of an ad hom attack can be to undermine
someone without actually engaging with the substance of their argument.
After Sally presents an eloquent and compelling case for a more equitable
taxation system, Sam asks the audience whether we should believe anything
from a woman who isn’t married, was once arrested, and smells a bit weird.
你讨论时针对对方的人格、动机、态度、地位、阶级或处境等，而进行攻击或评论，并以此当作提出了理据去驳斥对方的论证或去支持自己的论点

人身攻击时不一定是直接进行攻击，也可能是通过背后捅刀子、暗示听众等等方式来造成对对方人格的质疑。你试图用你对别人人格的攻击来取代一个有力的论述。更多关于人身攻击。

例子：当小明提出了一个很合理的关于基础设施建设的提议的时候吗，小红说她不相信任何小明说的话，因为小明不爱国，经常批评政府，不懂得感恩。小红犯了人身攻击的谬误。

---


## tu quoque               (诉诸虚伪)

Avoiding having to engage with criticism by turning it
back on the accuser - answering criticism with criticism.
Literally translating as ‘you too’ this fallacy is commonly employed as an
e_ective red herring because it takes the heat o_ the accused having to
defend themselves and shifts the focus back onto the accuser themselves.
Nicole identified that Hannah had committed a logical fallacy, but instead of
addressing the substance of her claim, Hannah accused Nicole of committing
a fallacy earlier on in the conversation.
你不正面回应别人对你的批评，而是用批评别人作为你的回复——“你不也曾经.....”

你想要把通过用批评回应批评的方式，免去你为自己辩护的责任。你通过这种方法来暗示对方是个虚伪的人，但是不管别人虚伪与否，你都只是在回避别人对你的批评。

例子：小明在和小红争论的时候指出小红犯了一个逻辑谬误，小红不正面捍卫自己，反而回应：“你之前也犯了逻辑谬误。” 小红在这里犯了诉诸虚伪的谬误

---


## personal incredulity    (个人怀疑)

Saying that because one finds something di_cult to
understand, it’s therefore not true.
Subjects such as biological evolution via the process of natural selection
require a good amount of understanding before one is able to properly grasp
them; this fallacy is usually used in place of that understanding.
Kirk drew a picture of a fish and a human and with e_usive disdain asked Richard
if he really thought we were stupid enough to believe that a fish somehow
turned into a human through just, like, random things happening over time.
你因为自己不明白或者知识水平不够，就得出一个事物可能是假的。

一些很复杂的概念，比如生物进化等等需要一些基本的理解和知识。有些人因为不理解这些复杂的概念，而觉得这些东西是错误的。

例子：小红指着块石头说：“你说进化论是真的，那你让这块石头进化人给我看看。”小红犯了个人怀疑的谬误。

---


## special pleading        (片面谬误)

Moving the goalposts or making up exceptions when a
claim is shown to be false.
Humans are funny creatures and have a foolish aversion to being wrong.
Rather than appreciate the benefits of being able to change one’s mind
through better understanding, many will invent ways to cling to old beliefs.
Edward Johns claimed to be psychic, but when his ‘abilities’ were tested under
proper scientific conditions, they magically disappeared. Edward explained this
saying that one had to have faith in his abilities for them to work.
当你的观点被证明是错误的时候，你用特例来给自己开脱。

人类都不喜欢被证明是错的，所以当他们被证明是错的时候总会想办法给自己开脱。人总是觉得自己以前觉得正确的东西必须是正确的吗，所以总能找到理由让自己阿Q一下。只有诚实和勇敢的人才能面对自己的错误，并且承认自己犯错了。

例子：小红说自己有特异功能，能用塔罗牌算出未出生小孩的性别，但是孩子生下来后发现猜错了，于是她就说是算命的人缺乏信仰。小红犯了片面谬误。

---


## loaded question         (诱导性问题)

Asking a question that has an assumption built into it so
that it can’t be answered without appearing guilty.
Loaded question fallacies are particularly e_ective at derailing rational debates
because of their inflammatory nature - recipients of a loaded question are
compelled to defend themselves and may appear flustered or on the back foot.
Grace and Helen were both romantically interested in Brad. One day, with
Brad sitting within earshot, Grace asked in an inquisitive tone whether Helen
was having any problems with a fungal infection.
你在提出问题的时候加入了诱导的成分，使得对方只能按着你的意思来回答。

你试图用诱导性的问题来逼对方回答你提出的低级问题，从而破坏理性的讨论。

例子：小红怀疑自己的丈夫孙越搞外遇，为了一探究竟，于是就问他：“陈轩的屁股上是不是有个胎记？”小红使用的就是诱导性问题。

---


## burden of proof         (举证责任)

Saying that the burden of proof lies not with the person
making the claim, but with someone else to disprove.
The burden of proof lies with someone who is making a claim, and is not upon
anyone else to disprove. The inability, or disinclination, to disprove a claim does
not make it valid (however we must always go by the best available evidence).
Bertrand declares that a teapot is, at this very moment, in orbit around the
Sun between the Earth and Mars, and that because no one can prove him
wrong his claim is therefore a valid one.
你认为举证责任不在提出观点的人，而在于质疑观点的人。

当有人提出一个观点结果被人质疑后，你认为举证的责任不在提出观点的人，而在质疑者。不能证伪一个事物，或者举出反例，并不能证明这个事物的合理性。当然，如果只因为没有足够的证据说明一个事物是合理的并不能肯定的说明它是不合理的。

例子：小红说他相信宇宙是一个叫KengDie的全知全能神创造的，因为没有人能证明KengDie不存在，所以KengDie是存在的。小红犯了举证责任的谬误。

---


## ambiguity               (语义模糊)

Using double meanings or ambiguities of language to
mislead or misrepresent the truth.
Politicians are often guilty of using ambiguity to mislead and will later point to
how they were technically not outright lying if they come under scrutiny.
It’s a particularly tricky and premeditated fallacy to commit.
When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he
said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking
here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there.
你用双关语或者意思存有歧义的语言来歪曲事实。

你使用双关语或者意思存有歧义的语言，当你被别人批评的时候又利用这些有歧义的语言作为自己的挡箭牌。

例子：地上一个猴，树上qi个猴，一共几个猴？

---


## the gambler's fallacy   (赌徒谬误)

Believing that ‘runs’ occur to statistically independent
phenomena such as roulette wheel spins.
This commonly believed fallacy can be said to have helped create a city in the
desert of Nevada USA. Though the overall odds of a ‘big run’ happening may be
low, each spin of the wheel is itself entirely independent from the last.
Red had come up six times in a row on the roulette wheel, so Greg knew that
it was close to certain that black would be next up. Su_ering an economic
form of natural selection with this thinking, he soon lost all of his savings.
你认为随机事物的发生和之前发生的事情是有相关性的。

有人在看到独立的随机事件（比如抛硬币）时，总觉得会和前面的事情有相关性（前面连着五个正面，下一个肯定要是反面了。）

---

## bandwagon               (乐队花车)

Appealing to popularity or the fact that many people do
something as an attempted form of validation.
The flaw in this argument is that the popularity of an idea has absolutely no
bearing on its validity. If it did, then the Earth would have made itself flat for
most of history to accommodate this popular belief.
Shamus pointed a drunken finger at Sean and asked him to explain how so
many people could believe in leprechauns if they’re only a silly old superstition.
Sean, however, had had a few too many Guinness himself and fell o_ his chair.
你试图说明因为很多人都在做同一件事情/相信同一件事物，这件事情就是对的。

一个事物/观点的流行程度和它本身是否合理没有关系。地球是球形的，在人们相信地球是平的时代地球也是球形的，地球才不管你信不信它呢。

例子：看到《货币战争》那么畅销，小红相信一定是罗斯柴尔德和共济会在背后操纵着整个世界。小红犯了乐队花车谬误。

---


## appeal to authority     (诉诸权威)

Saying that because an authority thinks something,
it must therefore be true.
It’s important to note that this fallacy should not be used to dismiss the claims of
experts, or scientific consensus. Appeals to authority are not valid arguments, but
nor is it reasonable to disregard the claims of experts who have a demonstrated
depth of knowledge unless one has a similar level of understanding.
Not able to defend his position that evolution ‘isn’t true’ Bob says that he knows a
scientist who also questions evolution (and presumably isn’t herself a primate).
你利用一个权威人物/机构的观点来取代一个有力的论述。

要证明一个观点，只是摘录别人的观点是不够的， 至少要知道所提到的权威为什么有那样的观点。因为权威人物/机构也是会犯错误的，所以不能无条件的假设合理性。当然，权威人物/机构的观点有可能是对的，所以不能只因为对方使用了诉诸权威的谬误就认定这个观点肯定是错的。

例子：小红不知道怎么反驳进化论，于是就说：“我老公孙越是大科学家，他觉得进化论是错的。”小红犯了诉诸权威的额谬误。

---

## composition/division    (合成谬误)

Assuming that what’s true about one part of something
has to be applied to all, or other, parts of it.
Often when something is true for the part it does also apply to the whole, but
because this isn’t always the case it can’t be presumed to be true. We must
show evidence for why a consistency will exist.
Daniel was a precocious child and had a liking for logic. He reasoned that
atoms are invisible, and that he was made of atoms and therefore invisible too.
Unfortunately, despite his thinky skills, he lost the game of hide and go seek.
你认为一个总体的组成部分所具有的特性，对于这个总体的其它部分也是普适的。

很多时候，对于一个组成部分存在合理性的事物，对于其它组成部分并不具有合理性。我们常能观察到事物之间的一致性，所以当一致性不存在的时候也会偏见的认为有一致性。

例子：小红买了辆自行车，当她看到自行车的车座是人造革的时候，她就觉得自行车的其它部位也是人造革的。

---


## no true scotsman        (没有真正的苏格兰人)

Making what could be called an appeal to purity as a way
to dismiss relevant criticisms or flaws of an argument.
This fallacy is often employed as a measure of last resort when a point has been
lost. Seeing that a criticism is valid, yet not wanting to admit it, new criteria are
invoked to dissociate oneself or one’s argument.
Angus declares that Scotsmen do not put sugar on their porridge, to which
Lachlan points out that he is a Scotsman and puts sugar on his porridge.
Furious, like a true Scot, Angus yells that no true Scotsman sugars his porridge.
你提出了一个观点，并收到了别人的批评，你试图用“诉诸纯洁”的方式来捍卫自己的观点。

你试图通过马后炮和修改标准的方式来维护自己那有缺陷的观点。

例子：
小红：“所有荷兰人都喜欢喝胡辣汤”。
小明：“孙越就是荷兰人，他就不喜欢喝胡辣汤。”
小红：“好吧，所有【真正的】荷兰人都喜欢喝胡辣汤。”<——小红这里就犯了“没有真正的苏格兰人”的谬误

---

## genetic                 (基因谬误)

Judging something good or bad on the basis of where it
comes from, or from whom it comes.
To appeal to prejudices surrounding something’s origin is another red herring
fallacy. This fallacy has the same function as an ad hominem, but applies
instead to perceptions surrounding something’s source or context.
Accused on the 6 o’clock news of corruption and taking bribes, the senator
said that we should all be very wary of the things we hear in the media,
because we all know how very unreliable the media can be.
你通过一个事物的出身来判断它的好坏。

你试图逃避正面的讨论，而转而讨论事物的出处。这种做法和本文第六条“人身攻击”类似，都是想试图通过已有的负面印象来从侧面攻击对方，却不能正面的回应对方的论述。

例子：
小明：“孙越不喜欢喝胡辣汤。”
小红：“孙越是荷兰人，怎么会不喜欢喝胡辣汤？”<——小红这里就犯了基因谬误

---


## black or white          (非黑即白)

Where two alternative states are presented as the only
possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist.
Also known as the false dilemma, this insidious tactic has the appearance of
forming a logical argument, but under closer scrutiny it becomes evident that
there are more possibilities than the either/or choice that is presented.
Whilst rallying support for his plan to fundamentally undermine citizens’
rights, the Supreme Leader told the people they were either on his side, or on
the side of the enemy.
你把黑和白作为仅有的可能，却忽略了其它可能性的存在。

你使用了简单粗暴的假二分法，来掩盖其它可能性的存在。你想通过非黑即白的选择来误导讨论，破坏辩论的建设性。

例子：在谈到反恐战争时，总统说如果你不支持反恐战争，你就是支持恐怖分子。总统这里犯了非黑即白的谬误。

---


## begging the question    (窃取论点)

A circular argument in which the conclusion is included
in the premise.
This logically incoherent argument often arises in situations where people
have an assumption that is very ingrained, and therefore taken in their minds
as a given. Circular reasoning is bad mostly because it’s not very good.
The word of Zorbo the Great is flawless and perfect. We know this because it
says so in The Great and Infallible Book of Zorbo’s Best and Most Truest
Things that are Definitely True and Should Not Ever Be Questioned.
你采用循环论证的方法来证明一个被包含在前提里面的观点。

这是一种逻辑智商破产的谬误，因为你把你的前提假设默认为真的，然后利用循环论证的方式来证明它。

例子：KengDie教的经文《KengDie Sutra》里面说的东西都是真理，因为在《KengDie Sutra》第一章第二段里面提到了“KengDie所述都是真理。”

---


## appeal to nature        (诉诸自然)

Making the argument that because something is ‘natural’
it is therefore valid, justified, inevitable, good, or ideal.
Many ‘natural’ things are also considered ‘good’, and this can bias our thinking;
but naturalness itself doesn’t make something good or bad. For instance
murder could be seen as very natural, but that doesn’t mean it’s justifiable.
The medicine man rolled into town on his bandwagon o_ering various
natural remedies, such as very special plain water. He said that it was only
natural that people should be wary of ‘artificial’ medicines like antibiotics.
你认为一个事物是“自然”的，所以它是合理、必然并且更好的。

一个事物是自然的并不一定代表它就更好。互相杀戮是大自然中普遍存在的现象，但是大多数人都认为我们不应该互相屠杀。

例子：小红认为吃草药肯定比吃人工制造的药有效，因为草药更加“自然”。小红犯了诉诸自然的谬误

---


## anecdotal               (轶事证据)

Using personal experience or an isolated example instead
of a valid argument, especially to dismiss statistics.
It’s often much easier for people to believe someone’s testimony as opposed to
understanding variation across a continuum. Scientific and statistical measures
are almost always more accurate than individual perceptions and experiences.
Jason said that that was all cool and everything, but his grandfather smoked,
like, 30 cigarettes a day and lived until 97 - so don’t believe everything you read
about meta analyses of sound studies showing proven causal relationships.
你试图用个人经验或者单独事例来取代逻辑论述或者有力的证据。

比起复杂而确凿的证据来说，轶事证据更容易获得，但是却要粗浅很多。在绝大多数情况下，量化衡量的科学数据/确凿证据比个人经验/轶事要更加可信。

例子：小红爷爷是个30年的老烟枪，现在80多岁身体还很健康，小红依次得出吸烟对身体无害的结论。小红犯了轶事证据的谬误。

---


## the texas sharpshooter  (德克萨斯神枪手)
Cherry-picking data clusters to suit an argument, or
finding a pattern to fit a presumption.
This ‘false cause’ fallacy is coined after a marksman shooting at barns and then
painting a bullseye target around the spot where the most bullet holes appear.
Clusters naturally appear by chance, and don’t necessarily indicate causation.
The makers of Sugarette Candy Drinks point to research showing that of the
five countries where Sugarette drinks sell the most units, three of them are in
the top ten healthiest countries on Earth, therefore Sugarette drinks are healthy.
你在大量的数据/证据中小心的挑选出对自己的观点有利的证据，而不使用那些对自己不利的数据/证据。

你先开了一枪，然后在子弹击中的地方画上靶心，搞得自己真是个神枪手一样。你先决定了自己的立场，然后才开始找证据，并且你只找对自己有利的，而对于那些对自己不利的就选择性忽略。

例子：红X字会为了证明自己尽到了职责，到处宣传自己拨出了XXXX的善款，却只字不提自己公款消费的奢侈无度。红X字会犯了“德克萨斯神枪手”谬误

---


## mididle ground          (中间立场)

Saying that a compromise, or middle point, between two
extremes must be the truth.
Much of the time the truth does indeed lie between two extreme points, but
this can bias our thinking: sometimes a thing is simply untrue and a
compromise of it is also untrue. Half way between truth and a lie, is still a lie.
Holly said that vaccinations caused autism in children, but her scientifically
well-read friend Caleb said that this claim had been debunked and proven false.
Their friend Alice o_ered a compromise that vaccinations cause some autism.
你觉得两个极端观点的妥协，或者说中间立场，肯定是对的。

虽然大多数时候，真理确实存在于两种极端的中间地带，但是你不能轻易的认为只要是处于中间立场的观点就一定是正确的。谎言和实话的中间地带依然是谎言。

例子：小红认为疫苗会造成儿童自闭症，孙越从科学研究的结论中得出结论认为疫苗不会造成儿童自闭症，小明认为两者观点的妥协——疫苗会造成儿童自闭症，但不是全部的儿童自闭症——才是正确的。小明犯了中间立场的谬误。
